# Languages

A place to store various failed programming and markup language experiments. Projects in this repository range from written specification to partially implemented language.

## Why?

For fun. My interest in natural languages extended to programming languages at some point, and I am interested in how meaning is created via either modality. Note that I am an extremely enthusiastic novice at programming language design, so I very well may be doing all of this incorrectly. C'est la vie.

More to come, eventually.
