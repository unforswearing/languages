# Languages

A place to store various failed programming and markup language experiments. Projects in this repository range from written specification to partially implemented language.

## Why?

For fun. My interest in natural languages extended to programming languages at some point, and I am interested in how meaning is created via either modality. The projects above represent various ideas I've had while learning to program, an ongoing process.

> Note that I am just an extremely enthusiastic novice at programming language design, so I very well may be doing all of this incorrectly. C'est la vie.
